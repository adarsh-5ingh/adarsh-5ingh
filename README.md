# Hi there! 👋  
I’m *Adarsh Singh*, a Software Engineer based in India 🇮🇳  

I love turning design concepts into clean, scalable, and high-performance web apps.  

With *2.6+ years of corporate experience* and *3+ years of freelancing, I’ve built everything from **portfolios* to *EdTech platforms, **dashboards, and **job portals*.  
I also enjoy designing interfaces in *Figma* before bringing them to life in code.
