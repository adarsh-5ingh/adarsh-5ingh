### Hi there! 👋 
I’m [Adarsh Singh](https://adarsh-singh.com), a Software Engineer based in India 🇮🇳

I didn’t start out wanting to “write code.”  
I started out wanting to **build things** — little ideas, side projects, and tools that could make life easier.  

Over time, that curiosity turned into a craft.  
For the past **2.6+ years in corporate** and **2+ years as a freelancer**, I’ve been designing and building products —  
from **simple portfolios** to **dashboards**, **EdTech platforms**, and even **job portals**.  

I enjoy starting with a blank canvas in **Figma** 🎨, sketching interfaces that feel natural,  
and then turning them into **clean, scalable web apps** ⚡ that actually work in the real world.  

What excites me most?  
Not just writing code, but **shaping ideas into something people can use and enjoy** 💡.
